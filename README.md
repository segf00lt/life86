# life86

Game of Life in x86 assembly.

Unexpectedly, only 30 lines longer than the Go
implementation I wrote a while ago. Am I bad at Go (maybe)? Good at assembly (I highly doubt it)?
Or is the function of program complexity to line count for a given language non linear?
Go, C and Python are probably more logarithmic that assembly.

Anyway, still need to do better grid initialization (maybe use blue noise?). Also
gonna try and SIMD the neighbour checks.
